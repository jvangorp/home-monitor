============

This repository contains a collection of small scripts that form a monitoring system using a publish/subscribe pattern. This approach is used to receive data streamed by an [Eagle gateway](http://rainforestautomation.com/rfa-z109-eagle/) (built by [Rainforest Automation](http://rainforestautomation.com)) and push the data into a message queue for consumption by separate scripts.

**Figure 1** shows how the components of this monitoring system fit together. The Eagle gateway polls (via [ZigBee](http://www.zigbee.org) link) the BC Hydro meter monitoring my home electrical service and pushes XML fragments containing data via HTTP POST. The `eagle-endpoint.py` script (built with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)) receives the XML fragments and pushes them into a [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com) publish/subscribe queue. Other Python scripts (such as `demand2bidgely.py`) receive the XML fragments from the queue, parse out data of interest and push that data into other services (such as [Bidgely](https://www.bidgely.com), [dweet](http://dweet.io) and [EmonCMS](http://emoncms.org)). Check out the links below for two services that make power data from my home publicly available:

- [dweet.io feed](http://dweet.io/follow/vangorp-home)
- [ThingSpeak feed](https://thingspeak.com/channels/22462#publicview)

An overview of the publish/subscribe structure set up with RabbitMQ is shown in **Figure 2**. A _producer_ application publishes messages to an _exchange_ which feeds all received messages into multiple _queues_ (one for each _consumer_). RabbitMQ provides a simple mechanism for new consumers to subscribe to an exchange, passing back the name of the queue for that consumer to use. The Python implementation used here closely follows the [Python publish/subscribe tutorial](http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-python.html) posted on the RabbitMQ web site. The `eagle-endpoint.py` script receives XML fragments from the Eagle gateway and publishes them to an exchange, and consumer scripts subscribe to the exchange to receive these fragments and process them.

Additional details about the XML fragments generated by the Eagle gateway can be found in the Eagle Uploader API document in the [docs folder](https://github.com/jvangorp/monitor-apps/tree/master/docs).
